Hi, Iâ€™m Phil Mickel!
- I'm a PhD candidate specializing in medicinal chemistry, where my primary focus lies in synthesizing lead compounds, creating analogues, and testing their biochemical activity. With a solid foundation in Python, bash, and TCL, I have a track record of six currently published works and one in-progress.
- Currently, I am focused on medicinal chemistry within a research group while actively seeking opportunities to integrate computational methods into our projects. My aim is to utilize my expertise to develop new solutions and integrate current computational methods.
- This GitHub page serves as a portfolio, showcasing my progress in C++, Python, bash, and TCL, along with my ongoing efforts to introduce computational methodologies to my lab mates.
